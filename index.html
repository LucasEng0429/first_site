            <p>Happy is an old cat. He spends a lot of his day lounging around, in whatever spot he feels is most comfortable at the time. He’s an indoor cat, but whenever we open the door to let the dogs out, he always comes running out so he can eat grass.</p>
            <p>Happy is pretty friendly with one of my dogs, Katie. They don’t interact much, but when they do, it’s usually just friendly sniffs. My other dog, Izzy, however, loves biting at Happy. Happy usually will just run away, but sometime’s he’ll retalliate by giving Izzy a smack! It’s all in good fun though.</p>
